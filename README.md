## Definitions
  Mostly just hera so I can remember what the hell everything is.
  
#### Impulse Response
  Response to a short duration time signal
  
#### Fourier Transform
  Transforms functions to be characterized by sines and cosines.
  Transforms from time domain to the frequency domain.
  i.e. f(time) to F(freq)
